# Python - Cryptography School Assignments

This repository contains cryptography assignments programmed in Python 3.6 during my enrollment at Stockton University.

## Instructions to quickly run and verify the code:
1. Copy the desired code
2. Visit the online compiler https://www.tutorialspoint.com/execute_python3_online.php
3. Paste the code accordingly
4. Run the code

*The code can now run and be tested.*

### Description of each program:

- ```CyrptographyCiphers.py```:

  This program contains 3 different ciphers. "In cryptography, a cipher is an algorithm for performing encryption or decryption—a series of well-defined steps that can be followed as a procedure." These 4 ciphers are:
  1. ```Shift Cipher``` - "a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet." | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher
  2. ```Affine Cipher``` - "The Affine cipher is a type of monoalphabetic substitution cipher, wherein each letter in an alphabet is mapped to its numeric equivalent, encrypted using a simple mathematical function, and converted back to a letter." | https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implementation-affine-cipher/
  3. ```Vigenere Cipher``` - "The Vigenère cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers, based on the letters of a keyword." | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher
  
- ```IndexOfCoincidence.py``` - "In cryptography, coincidence counting is the technique of putting two texts side-by-side and counting the number of times that identical letters appear in the same position in both texts." | https://www.tutorialspoint.com/execute_python3_online.php
